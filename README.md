Precisely is an intelligent opportunity curation app.  
A plethora of opportunities are available across all disciplines which can help young people grow and develop themselves but due to lack of visibility and targeted marketing very few people know about them and avail their benefits. This platform aims to connect the maximum number of youth and talent to any opportunity.  

# What's different  
Most applications or websites in the market simply provide a huge database of opportunities where the user has to filter through categories, browse through 100s of random opportunities and still may not be able to find the right one.  
On these platforms, the people who post these opportunities are also not very sure if they will be able to reach the right audience.  
  
Preciselyâ€™s novel approach, backed by machine learning algorithms is an attempt to cater to the needs of the Indian workforce by connecting them to the right opportunities curated from a regularly updated database of more than 10,000 opportunities.  
Think of it as 'Spotify for Opportunities'
  
# Features  
- Simplistic UI (Every opportunity is represented in a card with all the relevant information including the deadline and eligibility)  
- Intelligent (Will employ algorithms like collaborative filtering and Deep Neural Network (DNN) to provide the users with an intelligent recommendation system, which adapts and evolves seamlessly with the user's changing interests.  
- Social (User can create their own collections of opportunities, share with others, follow other users, etc)  
- Wholesome (Regional languageDetails support, offline reminders for saved opportunities, etc.)
  
# Contribution Guidelines  
- You can help develop the frontend of the Android app.
- You can also help develop the recommendation system. But prior knowledge of machine learning algorithms would be very helpful. If terms like 'perceptron' and 'Loss Function' do not sound familiar, you should consider going through [Andrew Ng's machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) first.
